                 I practice gymnastics since I was two years old. I also love travelling, horse riding, reading and watching TV shows.

               <h2>Gymnastics</h2>
    <p>
      Artistic gymnastics has always been a big part of my life. I started when I was two, and it immediately became my passion. I was on a special timetable in secondary school so that I could train every afternoon. From the age of twelve to seventeen, I trained over twenty hours a week. My favorite apparatus has always been the floor, a discipline that has always given me exceptional sensations. But gymnastics isn't always an easy sport. It requires a great deal of mental strength, perseverance and composure. But gymnastics is a real school of life and has taught me a great deal.

               <h2>Horse riding</h2>
    <p>
             I've been riding since I was four. I've always loved animals, and even as a child I was never afraid of horses. On the contrary, I was a big fan of everything to do with horses (books, cartoons, etc.). Finally, when I was nine years old, I started riding competitively alongside gymnastics. I competed in the French championships several times, just like in gymnastics. I mainly competed in show jumping, but also in eventing. Five years ago, I became the owner of my first horse, Colibri du Bourrisson. I ride him four or five times a week, and I still compete in show-jumping with him. He's stabled at Fontenay-le-Fleury, thirty minutes from my home, so I can go there whenever I like.

               <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
               Ever since I was a little girl, I've loved reading. My passion for reading began with books about horses, then continued with adventure stories, science fiction, and finally ended with an addiction to romance books. For me, books and series are an escape, a kind of comfort. For this reason, I'm the kind of person who likes to reread the same book fifty times, and watch the same films and series over and over again. My favorite book will always be Joseph Kessel's The Lion, which had such an impact on me as a child. As for TV shows, it's a little less philosophical: Gossip Girl, Vampire Diaries and Lucifer are the three series I've each seen a good ten times. I also love the Marvel movies, especially the character of Tony Starks. I also love to travel, and would love to discover Australia and Latin America, two places I've never been before.
